# Trade Republic SDK

An unofficial TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for the Trade Republic API.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This is an unofficial SDK and is not affiliated with Trade Republic. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- üîê Two-step authentication with phone number, PIN, and SMS OTP
- üç™ Automatic session cookie management
- üìò Full TypeScript support
- üéØ Simple, intuitive API

## Installation

```bash
npm install trade-republic-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { TradeRepublicClient } from "trade-republic-sdk";

const client = new TradeRepublicClient();

try {
  // Step 1: Initiate login (sends OTP to your device)
  await client.initiateLogin("+49151507xxxxx", "1234");

  // Step 2: Complete login with OTP received via SMS
  await client.completeLogin("5678");

  // Step 3: Use authenticated client
  const accountInfo = await client.getAccountInfo();
  console.log(accountInfo);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Authentication failed:", error);
}
```

## Authentication Flow

The Trade Republic API uses a two-step authentication process:

1. **Initial Login**: Send phone number and PIN to receive an OTP via SMS
2. **OTP Verification**: Complete authentication with the received OTP code

### Step-by-Step Example

```typescript
import { TradeRepublicClient } from "trade-republic-sdk";

const client = new TradeRepublicClient();

// Step 1: Initiate login
console.log("Sending login request...");
await client.initiateLogin(phoneNumber, pin);
console.log("OTP sent to your device");

// Step 2: Wait for user to receive OTP and enter it
const otpCode = "1234"; // Get this from user input
await client.completeLogin(otpCode);
console.log("Login successful!");

// Step 3: Make authenticated requests
if (client.isAuthenticated()) {
  const accountInfo = await client.getAccountInfo();
  console.log("Account Info:", accountInfo);
}
```
